It should be easy to do the right thing, and easy to spot if we've done the wrong thing.

- providing enough team feedback so that we don't go down dead ends too often,
- multiple modes of checking,
- not leaving checking until the end,
- discussing ethics and data hazards.

## QA activities

- Peer review,
- Code review,
- Ethics discussions,
- Pair programming,
- Internal workshops to discuss an approach,
- Maintain a 4:1 ratio -- 80% working on projects and 20% assisting with QA on other projects.
