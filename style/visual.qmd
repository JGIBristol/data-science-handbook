The University [brand guidelines](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/marketing/SitePages/Brand-guidlines.aspx) contain information on:

- the use of the University logo,
- the University colour scheme,
- the University fonts and typography.

We also have JGI-specific resources:

- **Word and PowerPoint templates** for letter, short reports, long reports and presentations.
  These can be found in the [JGI SharePoint](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-jeangoldinginstituteteam/Shared%20Documents/Forms/All.aspx).
  Click the `New` menu and then choose a template from the list.
  
- **Quarto template** for HTML and Word documents produced from Markdown and code.
  This can be found in the [JGI GitHub](https://github.com/JGIBristol/quarto-uob-jgi/).
  It can be used by running `quarto use template jgibristol/quarto-uob-jgi`.
