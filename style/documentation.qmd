Your project should contain both:

- [project documentation](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/project_documentation.html): as a minimum a `README.txt`,
- [code documentation](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/code_documentation.html): including inline comments, function, class and module docstrings,

The documentation should allow another data scientist (or you in a few years time!) to understand and pick up your work.

It is helpful to think of documentation as falling into one of four modes:

- **tutorials**: _learning-oriented_ lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind,

- **how-to guides**: _goal-oriented_ directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem,

- **reference guides**: _information-oriented_ technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it,

- **explanation**: _understanding-oriented_ discussion that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic.

The is a great breakdown of these four areas on the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) website.
