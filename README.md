### Style guide

- We prefer "we do X", "we recommend X" or "X might be useful", instead of over "you must do X".

- This handbook contains our recommendations and factual information for the team, but we try not to make it too opinionated where it doesn't need to be.

- Please write Markdown with [one sentence per line](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/write-git#one-sentence-per-line), rather than using a character limit per line.
